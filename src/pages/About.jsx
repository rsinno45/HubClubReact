              <h4 className="section-subtitle">HISTORY OF THE HUB CLUB</h4>
              <p className="about-text">
                The HUB Club has been assisting small businesses since 2003 with
                securing federal contracts. In 2006, The HUB Club changed its
                name from Quick Turnaround Services to the HUB Club due to the
                huge demand for HUBZone Certified Business. With 3% of all
                contracts required to go to HUBZone businesses, the need was
                there and hence the name change.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                Since 2012, the HUB Club has included other Socio-Economic
                Designations in its membership. In 2016, securing local and
                state MBEs and WBEs for HUB Club members became a necessity and
                a reality. With over 2,100 small businesses since 2003 with an
                assortment of Socio-Economic Designation and NAICS Codes, the
                HUB Club has assisted members with over $2 Billion in first time
                contracts over the past 20 years.
